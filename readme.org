* Link your Japanese sentence to external services or to the browser

** warning

 These features only work in the computer, not the browser.

* Features

There are 4 features in this addon.

Assume that there is a field called sentenceJp (that contains some japanese):


** Online transators

To add a link to both Google Translate and DeepL add the following to your card:

{{linktrans:sentenceJp}}

** Jisho translate

There is a way to do this in Anki, but I am lazy so I use:

{{jisho:sentenceJp}}

** Jisho Kanji

For every kanji in sentenceJp create a link to its corresponding Jisho page:

{{jishok:sentenceJp}}

** Go to the browser and find the kanji

This is a bit more complex. First, you need to have deck with kanji that has field called kanji, where, you guessed it right
contains the kanji. Use:

{{kbrowse:sentenceJP}}

Then every kanji in the sentence  will link to the browser at that specific kanji
